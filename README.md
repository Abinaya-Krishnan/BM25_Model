# BM25_Model

Baseline Model Execution steps

Run Baseline_bm25.py file. 

By successfully running Baseline_bm25.py file, outputs files named ‘BaselineModel_R101.dat to BaselineModel_R150.dat’ and ‘PTraining_benchmark101.txt to PTraining_benchmark150.txt’
will be generated.

Once the execution of Baseline_bm25.py is done, run the Training_bm25.py which generates ‘Model_w4_R101.dat to Model_w4_R150.dat’files.

Once the execution of Training_bm25.py is done, run Test_bm25.py file, which generates ‘result1.dat to result50.dat’

Finally execute Eval_basline.py file, which will generate EvaluationResult.dat

NOTE: Output files of each program is necessary to run the subsequent codes.
